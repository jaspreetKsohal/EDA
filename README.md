# Englewood Data Analytics
With Englewood being consistently ranked as one of the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in the city of Chicago, Englewood Data Analytics aims to raise awareness among people by showcasing community’s assets and providing a positive disruption to the constant portrayal of the community in bad light. In addition, this tool visualizes community’s data like demographics, vacant lots, services, green spaces etc. in order to provide sound evidence to policy makers that can lead to effective public policies ensuring the development of the area.
